I am a PhD student in the lab of Kevin Ochsner at Columbia University. I use behavioral and neuroimaging methods to study social and emotional development in humans.\'a0\
\
Previously, I worked in the lab of John Gabrieli at MIT researching development of neural systems supporting executive function and memory. I have master\'92s degrees in Mind, Brain, and Education from Harvard Graduate School of Education and Teaching from UC Santa Cruz, and a bachelor\'92s degree in history from New York University.\'a0\
\
Before I did brain research, I taught history at Berkeley High School, interned at Saturday Night Live, and was on the US National Team for synchronized swimming.\'a0\
